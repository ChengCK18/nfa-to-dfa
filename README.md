# nfa-to-dfa
This program is meant to convert Nondeterministic Finite Automata(NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA)
The logic of this program is still flawed as it would not produce desired output for certain inputs.

Known issue:
1. A epsilon circuit in the graph will cause the program to crash
2. Logic error might exist in the program as it's not tested comprehensively

Just compile the single java file and run the executable.
